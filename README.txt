This repository includes various practices based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains three folders:
- Comprehensive Projects: These are complex and complete web applications that incorporate advanced JavaScript features to enhance fundamental skills. In these projects, I code using vanilla JavaScript. Thanks to Jonas (https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), some of the projects are inspired by Jonas' online courses, while others come from various YouTubers' videos.
- CSS Practice: This folder is dedicated to practicing CSS skills, with a focus on layout.
- Small Features: Here, the focus is on effects and components that surprised me during my internet research.
